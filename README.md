# Organoid-imaging-analysis
This is the official implementation of paper: A Large Model-Derived Algorithm for Complex Organoids with Internal Morphogenesis and Digital Marker Derivation
We contributed our proposed algorithm Yolo_SAM and SAM Adapter to achieve segmentation of organoid morphological features and feature quantification of segmentation mask images
